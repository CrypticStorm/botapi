BotAPI
======

Node.js Discord bot providing interaction (and soon moderation) tools to users.

This is my first project in Javascript as a whole. I'm sure the code is ugly and
does not conform to any major style guide. Feel free to make recommendations and
I'll look into setting a standard for this project.
